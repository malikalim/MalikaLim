## Hi there 👋

Hi! If you’ve come to this page it likely means you are looking to work with me now or in the future. That’s pretty exciting! I’m going to give you a little breakdown of who I am and how I work best.

### [About Me]
I’m Malika. My name is pronounced like this Mah-lee-caw, if you’d like to hear it I usually include an audio recording in my slack profile. My pronouns are They/She. 
A little bit about me. I’m a ENTP-T. I am neurodivergent and therefore more extroverted provided I’m not masking.

I often will stim when listening to something. If you’ve been on a video call with me you might see me clicking something in my hand or bouncing. This is in order to help me process auditory feedback better. I also have a disability that can cause intermittiment shakes. Long story short if you see me shaking or bouncing it’s a Malika feature not a bug!

In a remote setting for meetings unless it’s on a 1:1 setting I will generally always ask for an option for captions. In gmeet the captions are available for everyone to use so that’s not an issue. For zoom if you don’t see CC at the bottom of the bar when you are hosting the meeting it might not have been enabled on your account. You can do that here [Video demo walkthrough TBD] You will need to have enabled this before a meeting for it to take effect unfortunately.

I much prefer slack over email. I’m a context over content person usually, I like knowing why or where a message is coming from. Reading between the lines sounds like my worst nightmare. I like including the urgency in [brackets] in a slack message so I know when to respond to a message. Sometimes I see a message popup in slack and my response is to drop what I’m doing to answer it because I perceive it to be high importance. That isn’t always the case! So including the urgency is really helpful for me 😁

Example of a slack message might look like this

```Hey 👋 [Not urgent]. Reaching out from a thought I had earlier about this meeting. Doesn't need a reply today!```

### [My go-to emoji codes]

- 👀 seen and looking (might not have an immediate response but it is on my radar)
- ✅ task/request done
- ❤️ / 🙏 acknowledging your response but I might not have one of my own
- 👩‍💻 focus block (in slack status), generally this means I'm working away at something so might be a bit slow to respond.
- I like to update my display name in slack when out of office, I will also update my calendar for ooo time slots. I like to utilize focus blocks as well on my calendar. If you see a focus block it doesn’t always mean I’m busy, just means that I am heads down at work on something as I find it easier to work when I’m not context switching. If you want to book a meeting with me just dm, I’m usually happy to move things around!
